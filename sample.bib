  abstract = {As information about COVID-19 safety behavior changed, people had to judge how likely others were to protect themselves through mask-wearing and vaccination seeking. In a large, campus-wide survey, we assessed whether University of Kansas students viewed others’ protective behaviors as different from their own, how much students assumed others shared their beliefs and behaviors, and which individual differences were associated with those estimations. Participants in our survey (N = 1, 704; 81.04 white, 64.08 female) estimated how likely they and others were to have worn masks on the University of Kansas campus, have worn masks off-campus, and to seek a vaccine. They also completed measures of political preference, numeracy, and preferences for risk in various contexts. We found that participants estimated that others were less likely to engage in health safety behaviors than themselves, but that their estimations of others were widely shared. While, in general, participants saw themselves as more unique in terms of practicing COVID-19 preventative behaviors, more liberal participants saw themselves as more unique, while those that were more conservative saw their own behavior as more similar to others. At least for masking, this uniqueness was false—estimates of others’ health behavior were lower than their actual rates. Understanding this relationship could allow for more accurate norm-setting and normalization of mask-wearing and vaccination.},

Whereas behavioral measures from the IGT and BART were uncorrelated, cognitive models revealed two reliable cross-task associations. Results suggest that the tasks similarly measure loss aversion and decision-consistency processes, but not necessarily the same learning process. Additionally, substance-using individuals (and especially stimulant users) performed worse on the IGT than healthy controls did, and this pattern could be explained by reduced decision consistency.},

Despite their prominence, full process models of these rating tasks have not been developed. We investigated whether a preference accumulation process, a process often used to model discrete choice, might explain ratings as well. According to our model, attributes from each option are sampled and evaluated stochastically. The evaluations are integrated over time, forming a preference. Preferences for options compete with each other, and accumulated preferences can decay. The model makes precise predictions regarding the statistical distribution of desirability ratings, as well as their dependence on deliberation time and on context. We test and confirm these predictions in two experimental studies. Additionally, quantitative model fits indicate that participants are better described by our proposed model, relative to a model without dynamism, competition, or stochastic attribute sampling. Our results show that the descriptive power of models of preference accumulation extends beyond discrete choice, and that the assumptions of this framework accurately characterize the core cognitive processes at play in the construction of preference and the evaluation of objects.},

Most relevant studies involved experimentation with humans which is often expensive, subject to strict institutional regulations, and hard to validate and replicate. Here we make use of a mathematical model of human decision-making and human confidence assessment developed by Pleskac and Busemeyer (2010) in order to compare four types of fusion operators: (1) operators that use human-subject decisions (such as the k-out-of-N majority rule); (2) operators that use subject decisions and error rates (the Chair and Varshney fusion rule); (3) operators that use subject decisions and confidence assessments (Yager's rule and the Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule #5); and (4) operators that use subject decisions, confidence assessments, and the average strength of each subject's confidence assessment, namely the average Brier scores (Dempster's rule of combination and Bayes' rule of probability combination). The ability of each fusion system to discriminate between alternatives was determined by computing the normalized area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). When the number of sources used by the fusion algorithm exceeded five, fusion operators which made use of decisions and confidence assessments alone (i.e., type (3)) produced the lowest (namely, worst) normalized AUC values. Operators which made use of subject reliabilities (i.e., types (2) and (4)) produced larger (namely, better) normalized AUC values which, in addition, were similar to those of fusion algorithms that relied on decisions alone (i.e., type (1)). For the city size discrimination task studied by Pleskac and Busmeyer, these results suggest that as the number of sources increases, the importance of decision self-assessment diminishes.},

Markov processes are based on the idea that at any given point in time a decision maker has a definite and specific level of support for available choice alternatives, and the dynamic decision process is represented by a single trajectory that traces out a path across time. When a response is requested, a person's decision or judgment is generated from the current location along the trajectory. By contrast, quantum processes are founded on the idea that a person's state can be represented by a superposition over different degrees of support for available choice options, and that the dynamics of this state form a wave moving across levels of support over time. When a response is requested, a decision or judgment is constructed out of the superposition by “actualizing” a specific degree or range of degrees of support to create a definite state. The purpose of this article is to introduce these two contrasting theories, review empirical studies comparing the two theories, and identify conditions that determine when each theory is more accurate and useful than the other.},

This implies the evidence or support recruited to make these judgments is based on the descriptions of the events (hypotheses) instead of the events themselves, as captured by Tversky and Koehler’s (1994) support theory. Support theory, however, assumes each hypothesis elicits a fixed level of support (support invariance). Here, across three studies, we tested this support invariance assumption by asking participants to estimate the probability that an event would occur given a set of relevant statistics. We show that the support recruited about a target hypothesis can depend on the other hypotheses under consideration. Results reveal that for a pair of competing hypotheses, one hypothesis (the target hypothesis) appears more competitive relative to the other when a dud–a hypothesis dominated by the target hypothesis–is present. We also find that the target hypothesis can appear less competitive relative to the other when a resembler–a hypothesis that is similar to the target hypothesis–is present. These context effects invalidate the support invariance assumption in support theory and suggest that a similar process that drives preference construction may also underlie belief construction.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, descriptive accounts of intertemporal choice have relied on static and deterministic models that assume alternative-wise processing of the options. Recent research, by contrast, has highlighted the dynamic and probabilistic nature of intertemporal choice and provided support for attribute-wise processing. Currently, dynamic models of intertemporal choice-which account for both the resulting choice and the time course over which the construction of a choice develops-rely exclusively on the framework of evidence accumulation. In this article, we develop and rigorously compare several candidate schemes for dynamic models of intertemporal choice. Specifically, we consider an existing dynamic modeling scheme based on decision field theory and develop two novel modeling schemes-one assuming lexicographic, noncompensatory processing, and the other built on the classical concepts of random utility in economics and discrimination thresholds in psychophysics. We show that all three modeling schemes can accommodate key behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice. When empirical choice and response time data were fit simultaneously, the models built on random utility and discrimination thresholds performed best. The results also indicated substantial individual differences in the dynamics underlying intertemporal choice. Finally, model recovery analyses demonstrated the benefits of including both choice and response time data for more accurate model selection on the individual level. The present work shows how the classical concept of random utility can be extended to incorporate response dynamics in intertemporal choice. Moreover, the results suggest that this approach offers a successful alternative to the dominating evidence accumulation approach when modeling the dynamics of decision making.},

This line of research culminated in the tradeoff model (Scholten & Read, 2010; Scholten, Read, & Sanborn, 2014), which can accommodate most established behavioral regularities in intertemporal choice. One drawback of the tradeoff model, however, is that it is static, providing no account of the dynamic process leading to a choice. Here we develop a dynamic tradeoff model that can qualitatively account for empirical findings in intertemporal choice regarding not only choices but also response times. The dynamic model also outperforms the original, static tradeoff model when quantitatively fitting choices from representative data sets, and even outperforms the best-performing dynamic model derived from Decision Field Theory in Dai and Busemeyer (2014) when fitting both choices and response times.},

The probability of each delay occurring either was explicitly described (timing risk) or could be learned through experiential sampling (timing uncertainty; the delay itself was not experienced). When the shorter delay was rare, people preferred the lottery more often when it was described than when it was experienced. When the longer delay was rare, this pattern was reversed. Modeling analyses suggested that underexperiencing rare delays and different patterns of probability weighting contribute to this description-experience gap. Our results challenge traditional models of intertemporal choice with temporal uncertainty as well as the generality of inverse-S-shaped probability weighting in such choice.},

Quantum probability theory has been proposed as an alternative framework upon which to develop models of cognition, including quantum random walk models. When modeling people’s behavior during decision-making tasks, previous work has demonstrated that both the Markov and quantum models have their respective strengths. Recently, the open system model, which is a hybrid version of the Markov and quantum models, has been shown to provide a more accurate account of preference strength compared to the Markov and quantum models in isolation. In this work, we extend the open system model to make predictions on pairwise choice and response time. We report a new experiment on preferential choice between gift cards, and we compare the fits of the open system model to the pure Markov and pure quantum random walk models using AIC, BIC, and

Here we examine whether this gap exists even when people draw on large samples. Although smaller, the gap persists. We use the choices of the present and previous studies to test a large set of candidate strategies that model decisions from experience, including 12 heuristics, two associative-learning models and the two-stage model of cumulative prospect theory. This model analysis suggests—as one explanation for the remaining description–experience gap in large samples—that people treat probabilities differently in both types of decisions.},

We argue this distinction is important because risky choices based on a priori (described) and statistical (experienced) probabilities can substantially diverge. To understand why, we examine various possible contributing factors to the description–experience gap. We find that payoff variability and memory limitations play only a small role in the emergence of the gap.

Extending on Herbert Simon's concept of bounded rationality, it holds that cognitive processes, including simple heuristics, are not per se rational or irrational, but that their success rests on their degree of fit to relevant environmental structures. The key is therefore to understand how cognitive and environmental structures slot together. In recent years, a growing set of analyses of heuristic–environment systems has deepened the understanding of the human mind and how boundedly rational heuristics can result in successful decision making. This article is concerned with three conceptual challenges in the study of ecological rationality. First, do heuristics also succeed in dynamic contexts involving competitive agents? Second, can the mind adapt to environmental structures via an unsupervised learning process? Third, how can research go beyond mere descriptions of environmental structures to develop theories of the mechanisms that give rise to those structures? In addressing these questions, we illustrate that a successful theory of rationality will focus on the adaptive aspects of the mind and will need to account for three components: the mind's information processing, the environment to which the mind adapts, and the intersection between the environment and the mind.},

  abstract = {Regenwetter and Robinson (2017) discuss a challenging construct–behavior gap in psychological research. It can emerge when testing hypotheses that pertain to a theoretical construct (e.g., preferences) on the basis of observed behavior (e.g., actual choices). The problem is that the different heuristic methods that are sometimes used to link overt choices to covert preferences may ignore heterogeneity between and within individuals, rendering inferences drawn from choices to preferences invalid. Regenwetter and Robinson’s remedy is to make heterogeneity an explicit part of the theory. They illustrate the problem and a remedy to it with the description–experience gap (D-E gap), the systematic gap in choices based on described versus ‘experienced’ probabilities. We welcome their sophisticated reanalysis of some early data sets, which, by taking heterogeneity into account, finds strong evidence for a D-E gap in probability weighting. Yet we see three issues with the remedy, which we likewise highlight using the D-E gap. First, the D-E gap cannot be reduced solely to probability weighting but rather unfolds across several different psychological constructs suggesting that part of the construct–behavior gap may stem from trying to reduce multidimensional behavior to a single construct. Second, the authors’ modeling of heterogeneity leaves aside the heterogeneity of people’s sampled experience in decisions from experience, which highlights the importance of also considering the potential causes of heterogeneity. Third, we identify potential sources of heterogeneity in choice behavior that go beyond probabilistic responses and preferences and advocate for a pluralistic approach to modeling it. Last but not least, we emphasize that, notwithstanding the importance of rigor and logical coherence in scientific theories, simplifications and (false) generalizations are indispensable in the pursuit of scientific knowledge.},

Here we examine how these constructive processes unfold by tracking dynamic changes in preference strength. Across two experiments, we observed that mean preference strength systematically oscillated over time and found that eliciting a choice early in time strongly affected the pattern of preference oscillation later in time. Preferences following choices oscillated between being stronger than those without prior choice and being weaker than those without choice. To account for these phenomena, we develop an open system dynamic model which merges the dynamics of Markov random walk processes with those of quantum walk processes. This model incorporates two sources of uncertainty: epistemic uncertainty about what preference state a decision maker has at a particular point in time; and ontic uncertainty about what decision or judgment will be observed when a person has some preference state. Representing these two sources of uncertainty allows the model to account for the oscillations in preference as well as the effect of choice on preference formation.},

To understand why, we asked 1,428 respondents to evaluate a hypothetical medical trial for a new Ebola vaccine offering three different payment amounts. Some respondents (27) used very high pay (£10,000) as a cue to infer the potential risks the clinical trial posed. These respondents were also concerned that offering £10,000 was coercive— simply too profitable to pass up. Both perceived risk and coercion in high-paying clinical trials shape how people evaluate these trials. This result was robust within and between respondents. The link between risk and repugnance may generalize to other markets in which parties are partially remunerated for the risk they take and contributes to a more complete understanding of why some market transactions appear repugnant.},

This assumption is stated in the form of the product rule, in which the support garnered for a particular hypothesis is independent of the support for the alternative hypothesis. In the study reported here, I asked participants to judge the likelihood of a bicyclist winning a simulated race. Results showed that the independence assumption was systematically violated. Observed judgments suggest that when a probability judgment is made, the comparability or similarity of the hypotheses on one dimension increases the weight that judges allocate to differences on the other dimensions. These results speak against the simple scalability-processing assumption of support theory, and they illustrate the need for a theory of judgment processes that describes how the similarity between hypotheses shapes judgment.},

First, small samples amplify the difference between the average earnings associated with the payoff distributions, thus rendering choices simpler. Second, people who use a simple choice heuristic or choose in accordance with prospect theory benefit from this amplification effect, whereas Bayesian updates do not. Third, although not providing a strictly veridical portrayal of the world, small samples can give rise to surprisingly competitive choices.},

Within the domain of risk, he set apart a priori and statistical probabilities, a distinction that maps onto that between decisions from description and experience, respectively. We argue this distinction is important because risky choices based on a priori (described) and statistical (experienced) probabilities can substantially diverge. To understand why, we examine various possible contributing factors to the description–experience gap. We find that payoff variability and memory limitations play only a small role in the emergence of the gap. In contrast, the presence of rare events and their representation as either natural frequencies in decisions from experience or single-event probabilities in decisions from description appear relevant for the gap. },

These studies reveal that under some conditions untrained individuals shoot unarmed Black men more than unarmed White men. We modeled the decision to shoot as a sequential sampling process in which people start out with prior biases and accumulate evidence over time until a threshold is reached, prompting a decision. We used this approach to test how prior information (a proxy for police dispatch information) and police experience influence racial bias in shooting decisions. When no prior information was given, target race biased the rate at which untrained civilians accumulated evidence, leading to a greater rate of shooting Black targets. For sworn police officers, the race of the target impacted prior bias, but not evidence accumulation. Moreover, officers showed no race bias in the observed decision to shoot. For both untrained civilians and sworn police officers, prior information about a target's race was sufficient to eliminate racial bias in shooting decisions both at the process and behavioral level. These studies reveal that factors present in real-world shooting decisions (dispatch information and police experience) can moderate the role that race plays both in the underlying cognitive processes and ultimately on the observed decision. We discuss the benefits of using a dynamic cognitive model to understand the decision to shoot and the implications of these results for laboratory analogues of real-world decisions.},

In contrast, quantum decision models assume that evidence develops over time in a superposition state analogous to a wavelike pattern and that judgments and decisions are constructed by a measurement process by which a definite state of evidence is created from this indefinite state. This constructive process implies that interference effects should arise when multiple responses (measurements) are elicited over time. We report such an interference effect during a motion direction discrimination task. Decisions during the task interfered with subsequent confidence judgments, resulting in less extreme and more accurate judgments than when no decision was elicited. These results provide qualitative and quantitative support for a quantum random walk model of evidence accumulation over the popular Markov random walk model.

We review the structure of these heuristics and show that they make a number of implicit assumptions resulting from the formal classical logic that underpins their structure. These assumptions lead to a number of predictions that are inconsistent with existing empirical data, but they follow primarily from the classical logic structure of heuristics and not from the rule-based cue processing approach itself. We introduce an alternative logic based on quantum theory that proposes a different and potentially more accurate set of underlying assumptions, and show that this framework addresses many of the issues arising from classical logic. We then demonstrate how heuristics can be reconstructed by integrating them with a quantum logic structure, examine the benefits that heuristics and quantum logic provide to one another, and outline the new questions and predictions that their integration yields. We contend that the integration of heuristics with quantum logic enhances both frameworks, improving heuristics as descriptive models by bringing them closer to the empirical data and grounding quantum logic in a psychological theory by giving it concrete processing rules to implement.},

We examine this assumption by directly manipulating the number of samples and the proportion favoring either of two alternatives in dynamic decision making and judgment tasks. The results suggest that people tend to over-emphasize the strength of evidence relative to its weight in both an optional-stopping decision task and a probability judgment task. In a drift-diffusion model, this is reflected by drift rates that are determined foremost by strength with a smaller influence of weight. This result challenges the proportional representation assumption made by existing models of judgment and decision-making, and calls into question modeling evidence accumulation as a Bayesian belief updating process.},

In two experiments (N = 183), participants first priced monetary gambles drawn from environments in which risks and rewards were negatively correlated, positively correlated, or uncorrelated. In later trials, they evaluated gambles with uncommon combinations of risk and reward—that is, options that deviated from the respective environment's risk–reward structure. Pricing, response times, and (in Experiment 2) pupil dilation were recorded. In both experiments, participants took more time when responding to uncommon compared to foreseeable options or when the same options were presented in an uncorrelated risk–reward environment. This result was most pronounced when the uncommon gambles offered higher expected values compared to the other gambles in the set. Moreover, these uncommon, high-value options were associated with an increase in pupil size.

However, the mechanisms of risk-taking behavior are not well-understood in BD. Recent data suggest prior substance use disorder (SUD) in BD may represent certain trait-level vulnerabilities for risky behavior. This study examined the mechanisms of risk-taking and the role of SUD in BD via mathematical modeling of behavior on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Three groups—18 euthymic BD with prior SUD (BD+), 15 euthymic BD without prior SUD (BD–), and 33 healthy comparisons (HC)—completed the BART. We modeled behavior using four competing hierarchical Bayesian models, and model comparison results favored the Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model, which encompasses and delineates five cognitive components of risk-taking: prior belief, learning rate, risk preference, loss aversion, and behavioral consistency. Both BD groups, regardless of SUD history, showed lower behavioral consistency than HC. BD+ exhibited more pessimistic prior beliefs (relative to BD– and HC) and reduced loss aversion (relative to HC) during risk-taking on the BART. Traditional measures of risk-taking on the BART (adjusted pumps, total points, total pops) detected no group differences. These findings suggest that reduced behavioral consistency is a crucial feature of risky decision-making in BD and that SUD history in BD may signal additional trait vulnerabilities for risky behavior even when mood symptoms and substance use are in remission. This study also underscores the value of using mathematical modeling to understand behavior in research on complex disorders like BD.},

  abstract = {People often have to make decisions under uncertainty—that is, in situations where the probabilities of obtaining a payoff are unknown or at least difficult to ascertain. One solution to this problem is to infer the probability from the magnitude of the potential payoff and thus exploit the inverse relationship between payoffs and probabilities that occurs in many domains in the environment. Here, we investigated how the mind may implement such a solution: (1) Do people learn about risk–reward relationships from the environment—and if so, how? (2) How do learned risk–reward relationships impact preferences in decision-making under uncertainty? Across three experiments (N = 352), we found that participants can learn risk–reward relationships from being exposed to choice environments with a negative, positive, or uncorrelated risk–reward relationship. They were able to learn the associations both from gambles with explicitly stated payoffs and probabilities (Experiments 1 & 2) and from gambles about epistemic events (Experiment 3). In subsequent decisions under uncertainty, participants often exploited the learned association by inferring probabilities from the magnitudes of the payoffs. This inference systematically influenced their preferences under uncertainty: Participants who had been exposed to a negative risk–reward relationship tended to prefer the uncertain option over a smaller sure option for low payoffs, but not for high payoffs. This pattern reversed in the positive condition and disappeared in the uncorrelated condition. This adaptive change in preferences is consistent with the use of the risk–reward heuristic.},

  abstract = {Sequential sampling models provide a useful framework for understanding human decision making. A key component of these models is an evidence accumulation process in which information is accrued over time to a threshold, at which point a choice is made. Previous neurophysiological studies on perceptual decision making have suggested accumulation occurs only in sensorimotor areas involved in making the action for the choice. Here we investigated the neural correlates of evidence accumulation in the human brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while manipulating the quality of sensory evidence, the response modality, and the foreknowledge of the response modality. We trained subjects to perform a random dot motion direction discrimination task by either moving their eyes or pressing buttons to make their responses. In addition, they were cued about the response modality either in advance of the stimulus or after a delay. We isolated fMRI responses for perceptual decisions in both independently defined sensorimotor areas and task-defined nonsensorimotor areas. We found neural signatures of evidence accumulation, a higher fMRI response on low coherence trials than high coherence trials, primarily in saccade-related sensorimotor areas (frontal eye field and intraparietal sulcus) and nonsensorimotor areas in anterior insula and inferior frontal sulcus. Critically, such neural signatures did not depend on response modality or foreknowledge. These results help establish human brain areas involved in evidence accumulation and suggest that the neural mechanism for evidence accumulation is not specific to effectors. Instead, the neural system might accumulate evidence for particular stimulus features relevant to a perceptual task.},

We formalize this process in a new model, Choice from Accumulated Samples of Experience (CHASE). The model provides a good account of choice behavior and goes beyond existing models by explaining variations in sample size under different task conditions. This approach offers a process-level framework for understanding how interactions between the choice environment and properties of the decision maker give rise to decisions from experience.},

For Experiment 1, participants were told at the start that musicians typically outperform nonmusicians on the task, and then they were asked to identify themselves as either a “musician” or a “nonmusician.” For Experiment 2, participants were given either a promotion focus prime (a performance-based opportunity to gain entry into a raffle) or a prevention focus prime (a performance-based criterion that needed to be maintained to avoid losing an entry into a raffle) at the start of the experiment. Consistent with a regulatory-fit hypothesis, self-identified musicians and promotion-primed participants given a gains reward structure made more correct tone classifications and were more likely to discover the optimal disjunctive rule than were musicians and promotion-primed participants experiencing losses. Reward structure (gains vs. losses) had inconsistent effects on the performance of nonmusicians, and a weaker regulatory-fit effect was found for the prevention focus prime. Overall, the findings from this study demonstrate a regulatory-fit effect in the domain of auditory category learning and show that motivational orientation may contribute to musician performance advantages in auditory perception.},

An adaptive mind can exploit this association by, for instance, using a potential reward's size to infer the probability of obtaining it. However, a mind can only adapt to and exploit an environmental structure if it is ecologically reliable, that is if it is frequent and recurrent. We develop the competitive risk-reward ecology theory (CET) that establishes how the ecology of competition can make the association of high rewards with low probabilities ubiquitous. This association occurs because of what is known as the ideal free distribution (IFD) principle. The IFD states that competitors in a landscape of resource patches distribute themselves proportionally to the gross total amount of resources in the patches. CET shows how this principle implies a risk-reward structure: an inverse relationship between probabilities and payoffs. It also identifies boundary conditions for the risk-reward structure, including heterogeneity of resources, computational limits of competitors, and scarcity of resources. Finally, a set of empirical studies (N = 1,255) demonstrate that people's beliefs map onto properties predicted by CET and change as a function of the environment. In sum, grounding people's inferences in CET demonstrates how the behaviors of a boundedly rational mind can be better predicted once accounts of the mind and the environment are fused.},

stochastic models that describe the cognitive processes of individuals while they
complete multiple trials of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al.,
2002). Wallsten, Pleskac, and Lejuez (2004) designed the models using prospect
theory and a Bayesian learning process to better understand why the BART correlates
so well with self-reported risky behaviors. The models differed in terms of the
individuals’ beliefs of the task’s probabilistic structure and when option evaluations
occur. The models revealed that although respondents use a Bayesian learning
process to understand the task, they misunderstand the BART’s stochastic process as
stationary. Results also indicated that individuals’ attitudes toward outcomes are, in
part, a source of the BART’s success. From these conclusions a new task was
developed that allows manipulations of both the actual stochastic structure and the
individuals’ level of knowledge regarding the structure. Participants (N = 71)
completed four different conditions of the task. Fitting the various cognitive models
to each individual’s data revealed that only a subset of the models correctly
distinguished between the stochastic processes underlying the different conditions.
Incorporating prospect theory’s weighting function and a trial-dependent bias
component into the models accounted for performance differences between
conditions. Of the assorted model parameters, only prospect theory’s value function
correlated with external self-reported risky drug use. The results also showed that the
learning component of the original BART may cloud its association to risky
behaviors. Implications in terms of gambling tasks and the cognitive models will be
discussed.},

Judges then interrupt the process to categorize the accumulated evidence into a confidence rating. The model explains all known interrelationships between the 3 indices of performance. Furthermore, the model also accounts for the distributions of each variable in both a perceptual and general knowledge task. The dynamic nature of the model also reveals the moderating effects of time pressure on the accuracy of choice and confidence. Finally, the model specifies the optimal solution for giving the fastest choice and confidence rating for a given level of choice and confidence accuracy.

A natural index in these tasks is the average number of risks the participant takes in a trial (e.g., pumps on the balloons), but this is difficult to estimate because some trials terminate early because of the consequences of those risks (e.g., when the desired number of balloon pumps exceeds the explosion point). The standard corrective strategy is to use an adjusted score that ignores such event-terminated trials. Although previous data supports the utility of this adjusted score, the authors show formally that it is biased. Therefore, the authors developed an automatic response procedure, in which respondents state at the beginning of each trial how many risks they wish to take and then observe the sequence of events unfold. A study comparing this new automatic and the original manual BART shows that the automatic procedure yields unbiased statistics whereas maintaining the BART's predictive validity of substance use. The authors also found that providing respondents with the expected-value-maximizing strategy and complete trial-by-trial feedback increased the number of risks they were willing to take during the BART. The authors interpret these results in terms of the potential utility of the automatic version including shorter administration time, unbiased behavioral measures, and minimizing motor involvement, which is important in neuroscientific investigations or with clinical populations with motor limitations.},

This relationship between risk and reward or probabilities and payoffs seems obvious to the financial community and to laypeople alike. Yet theories of decision making have largely ignored it. We conducted an ecological analysis of life's gambles, ranging from the domains of roulette and life insurance to scientific publications and artificial insemination. Across all domains, payoffs and probabilities proved intimately tied, with payoff magnitudes signaling their probabilities. In some cases, the constraints of the market result in these two core elements of choice being related via a power function; in other cases, other factors such as social norms appear to produce the inverse relationship between risks and rewards. We offer evidence that decision makers exploit this relationship in the form of a heuristic--the risk-reward heuristic--to infer the probability of a payoff during decisions under uncertainty. We demonstrate how the heuristic can help explain observed ambiguity aversion. We further show how this ecological relationship can inform other aspects of decision making, particularly the approach of using monetary lotteries to study choice under risk and uncertainty. Taken together, these findings suggest that theories of decision making need to model not only the decision process but also the environment to which the process is adapted.},

In this article, we examine how multiple response pathways develop over repeated risky decisions. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) as a case study, we show that 2 different response pathways emerge over the course of the task. The assessment pathway is a slower, more controlled pathway where participants deliberate over taking a risk. The 2nd pathway is a faster, more automatic process where no deliberation occurs. Results imply the slower assessment pathway is taken as choice conflict increases and that the faster automatic response is a learned response. Based on these results, we modify an existing formal cognitive model of decision making during the BART to account for these dual response pathways. The slower more deliberative response process is modeled with a sequential sampling process where evidence is accumulated to a threshold, while the other response is given automatically. We show that adolescents with conduct disorder and substance use disorder symptoms not only evaluate risks differently during the BART but also differ in the rate at which they develop the more automatic response. More broadly, our results suggest cognitive models of judgment decision making need to transition from treating observed decisions as the result of a single response pathway to the result of multiple response pathways that change and develop over time.},

For example, to understand the role of race in police officers’ decisions to shoot, participants have been shown images of Black and White males and instructed to shoot only if the target is holding a gun. Findings show that Black targets are shot more frequently and more quickly than Whites. The decision to shoot has typically been modeled and understood as a signal detection process in which a sample of information is compared against a criterion, with the criterion set for Black targets being lower. We take a different approach, modeling the decision to shoot as a dynamic process in which evidence is accumulated over time until a threshold is reached. The model accounts for both the choice and response time data for both correct and incorrect decisions using a single set of parameters. Across four studies, this dynamic perspective revealed that the target’s race did not create an initial bias to shoot Black targets. Instead, race impacted the rate of evidence accumulation with evidence accumulating faster to shoot for Black targets. Some participants also tended to be more cautious with Black targets, setting higher decision thresholds. Besides providing a more cohesive and richer account of the decision to shoot or not, the dynamic model suggests interventions that may address the use of race information in decisions to shoot and a means to measure their effectiveness.},

The first study used this method to examine how information processing during deliberation differed from a perceptual analog of the task. We found participants were less sensitive to each sample of information during preferential choice. In a second study, we investigated how these different measures of deliberation were related to impulsivity and drug and alcohol use. We found that while properties of the deliberation process were not related to impulsivity, some aspects of the process may be related to substance use. In particular, alcohol abuse was related to diminished sensitivity to the payoff information and drug use was related to how the initial starting point of evidence accumulation. We synthesized our results with a rank-dependent sequential sampling model which suggests that participants allocated more attentional weight to larger potential payoffs during preferential choice.},

abstract = {When faced with a choice under incomplete knowledge, people can turn to the practical option of actively collecting information and ultimately deciding from experience. Here we review the dynamic interplay between perceiving and acting that arises during these decisions: What the person sees and experiences depends on how the person acts, and how the person acts depends on what the person has seen and experienced. We also review how this interaction and choice can be crucial to understanding risk-taking and how it can help advance our understanding of human competence. Finally, we contend that a truly successful model of how people make decisions from experience will capture this dynamic interplay.},

  abstract = {Items in working memory (WM) are prioritized if they are relevant to task goals, are physically salient, or have acquired importance from implicit learning. We propose that all forms of prioritization increase the likelihood of recall, but only goal-driven attention will affect the quality of those representations. In a delayed-estimation task with four colors, prioritization was manipulated via a predictive spatial cue (goal-driven attention), a non-predictive peripheral cue (physical salience), or implicit learning of a previously relevant target location. Probabilities of recalling the target (Ptarget) and memory precision were estimated using a Bayesian implementation of the mixture model. Strong evidence was observed that all forms of prioritization increased Ptarget, whereas physical salience and implicit learning had only weak or negligible effects on precision compared to goal-driven attention. We propose that generating and maintaining high-resolution memories is an effortful process that will primarily be invoked when participants voluntarily prioritize memory items.},

  abstract = {Risk-taking behavior is rarely a single action made in isolation but is often repeated and dynamic. Yet the role that risk perceptions play in risk taking have often been studied using descriptions of isolated single-shot activities. To better understand the link between risk perceptions and risk-taking behavior, we investigated risk perception in a dynamic choice environment, the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). In the BART, participants repeatedly inflate a virtual balloon earning points if the balloon does not explode. Across two studies, we measured risk perceptions by asking people to estimate the probability that the balloon would explode at different levels of inflation. Our results show that the probability ratings deviate both from the actual probabilities of an explosion and from those predicted by the most successful cognitive model of the BART. Yet the probability estimates correlated with the actual choice behavior. Moreover, we found that the very first experience in the BART was a critical factor in determining the perceptions of the risks in the task, and in turn subsequent risk-taking behavior. Taken together, the results help reveal the critical role that risk perceptions play in risky behavior and potentially can be used to improve our ability to identify real-world risk takers.},

SAT/ACT scores and HSGPA were collected and used in various ways by participating institutions in the admissions process while situational judgment measures and biodata were collected for research purposes only during the first few weeks of the participating students’ freshman year. Alternative outcomes such as a self-report of performance on a range of student performance dimensions and a measure of organizational citizenship behavior, as well as class absenteeism, were best predicted by noncognitive measures. The racial composition of a student body selected with only cognitive measures or both cognitive and noncognitive measures under various levels of selectivity as well as the performance of students admitted under these scenarios is also reported. The authors concluded that both the biodata and situational judgment measures could be useful supplements to cognitive indexes of student potential in college admissions.},

We modelled the choice behavioras a process where evidence, in the form of sequentially arriving social information from other participants choices, isaccumulated until a threshold is reached. Our results show that highly confident individuals start close to the threshold andthus respond fast.

To understand how information cascades through social systems, it is essential to capture the dynamics of the decision-making process. We introduce the social drift–diffusion model to capture these dynamics. We tested our model using a sequential choice task. The model was able to recover the dynamics of the social decision-making process, accurately capturing how individuals integrate personal and social information dynamically over time and when their decisions were timed. Our results show the importance of the interrelationships between accuracy, confidence, and response time in shaping the quality of information cascades.

Nonetheless, we only have a rudimentary understanding of which choices are more likely to initiate cascades. Here we investigate the role of response time (RT) asymmetries (i.e., one choice alternative being selected faster than the other) in shaping behavioural cascades by combining an empirical and modelling approach. RT asymmetries are found in a wide range of decision-making contexts, including police shooting, risky choice, and memory retrieval. How they shape collective dynamics, is, however, unknown. Applying evidence accumulation models to analyse behaviour in a sequential choice paradigm, we show that RT asymmetries crucially shape behavioural cascades. Using simulations, we show that especially start point biases (and to a less extent varying drift rates) can initiate cascades, as they lead to rapid choices for one choice alternative. Our results highlight the importance of RT asymmetries in shaping collective dynamics.},

Here we argue that cognitive modeling, in tandem with experiments that allow collective dynamics to emerge, can mechanistically link cognitive processes at the individual and collective levels. We illustrate the strength of this cognitive computational approach with two highly successful cognitive models that have been applied to interactive group experiments: evidence-accumulation and reinforcement-learning models. We show how these approaches make it possible to simultaneously study (a) how individual cognition drives social systems, (b) how social systems drive individual cognition, and (c) the dynamic feedback processes between the two layers.},

Thus, to remember successfully, one must actively maintain relevant information and prevent distraction from entering working memory. Researchers suggest the basal ganglia-prefrontal pathways are vital to this process by acting as a working memory gate. Using Parkinson’s disease as a model of frontostriatal functioning and with signal detection analyses, the present study aims to better characterize the contribution of frontostriatal pathways of this gating process and to determine how it operates across multiple domains. To achieve this, Parkinson’s disease patients and healthy controls completed verbal and spatial working memory tasks consisting of three conditions: low-load without distraction; low-load with distraction; and high-load without distraction. Patients were tested both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication, allowing for assessment of the contribution of dorsal and ventral frontostriatal pathways. The results demonstrate that when medication is withheld, Parkinson’s patients have a response bias to answer “NO” across all conditions and domains, supporting our hypothesis that the basal ganglia-prefrontal pathways allow or prevent updates of working memory. Contrastingly, medication status affects d′ in the distraction condition but not in the high- or low-load conditions. We attribute this to stimulus valuation processes that were impaired by dopaminergic medication overdosing the ventral pathway. These findings are both consistent with the hypothesis that the working memory gate filters spatial and verbal information before it enters into the working memory system, adding support for the gate being a domain-general mechanism of the central executive.},

  abstract = {Beyond simply a decision process, repeated risky decisions also require a number of cognitive processes including learning, search and exploration, and attention. In this article, we examine how multiple response pathways develop over repeated risky decisions. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) as a case study, we show that 2 different response pathways emerge over the course of the task. The assessment pathway is a slower, more controlled pathway where participants deliberate over taking a risk. The 2nd pathway is a faster, more automatic process where no deliberation occurs. Results imply the slower assessment pathway is taken as choice conflict increases and that the faster automatic response is a learned response. Based on these results, we modify an existing formal cognitive model of decision making during the BART to account for these dual response pathways. The slower more deliberative response process is modeled with a sequential sampling process where evidence is accumulated to a threshold, while the other response is given automatically. We show that adolescents with conduct disorder and substance use disorder symptoms not only evaluate risks differently during the BART but also differ in the rate at which they develop the more automatic response. More broadly, our results suggest cognitive models of judgment decision making need to transition from treating observed decisions as the result of a single response pathway to the result of multiple response pathways that change and develop over time.},

We investigated this question with several four-armed bandit tasks manipulating (within subjects) expected reward, uncertainty, and time pressure (limited vs. unlimited). With limited time, people have less opportunity to perform costly computations, thus shifting the cost-benefit balance of different exploration strategies. Through behavioral, reinforcement learning (RL), reaction time (RT), and evidence accumulation analyses, we show that time pressure changes how people explore and respond to uncertainty. Specifically, participants reduced their uncertainty-directed exploration under time pressure, were less value-directed, and repeated choices more often. Since our analyses relate uncertainty to slower responses and dampened evidence accumulation (i.e., drift rates), this demonstrates a resource-rational shift towards simpler, lower-cost strategies under time pressure. These results shed light on how people adapt their exploration and decision-making strategies to externally imposed cognitive constraints.},

  abstract = {Most cognitive theories assume that confidence and choice happen simultaneously and are based on the same information. The 3 studies presented in this article instead show that confidence judgments can arise, at least in part, from a postdecisional evidence accumulation process. As a result of this process, increasing the time between making a choice and confidence judgment improves confidence resolution. This finding contradicts the notion that confidence judgments are biased by decision makers seeking confirmatory evidence. Further analysis reveals that the improved resolution is due to a reduction in confidence in incorrect responses, while confidence in correct responses remains relatively constant. These results are modeled with a sequential sampling process that allows evidence accumulation to continue after a choice is made and maps the amount of accumulated evidence onto a confidence rating. The cognitive modeling analysis reveals that the rate of evidence accumulation following a choice does slow relative to the rate preceding choice. The analysis also shows that the asymmetry between confidence in correct and incorrect choices is compatible with state-dependent decay in the accumulated evidence: Evidence consistent with the current state results in a deceleration of accumulated evidence and consequently evidence appears to have a decreasing impact on observed confidence. In contrast, evidence inconsistent with the current state results in an acceleration of accumulated evidence toward the opposite direction and consequently evidence appears to have an increasing impact on confidence. Taken together, this process-level understanding of confidence suggests a simple strategy for improving confidence accuracy: take a bit more time to make confidence judgments.},

For each choice, participants experienced the distribution of payoffs via rapid samples updated every 50ms. We show that people can make these rapid decisions from experience and that the decision process is consistent with a sequential sampling process. Results also reveal a dissociation between these preferential decisions and equivalent perceptual decisions where participants had to determine which alternatives contained more dots on average. To account for this dissociation, we developed a sequential sampling rank-dependent utility model, which showed that participants in the FGT attended more to larger potential payoffs than participants in the perceptual task despite being given equivalent information. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of computational models of preferential choice and a more complete understanding of experience-based decision making.},

Yet extant judgment theories leave 2 questions unanswered: (a) How are past exemplars and abstracted cue knowledge combined to form a judgment? (b) Are all past exemplars retrieved from memory to form the judgment (integrative retrieval) or is the judgment based on one exemplar (competitive retrieval)? To address these questions we propose and test a new model, CX-COM (combining Cue abstraction with eXemplar memory assuming COMpetitive memory retrieval). In a first step, CX-COM recalls only a single exemplar from memory. In a second step, the initially retrieved judgment is adjusted based on abstracted cue knowledge. Qualitatively, we show that CX-COM naturally captures judgment patterns that have been previously attributed to multiple strategies. Next, we tested CX-COM quantitatively in 2 experiments and found that it accounts well for people's judgment behavior. In the second experiment we additionally tested 2 qualitative predictions of CX-COM: The existence of multimodal response distributions within participants and systematic variability in judgments depending on the distance between similar exemplars in memory. The empirical results confirm CX-COM's assumptions. In sum, the evidence suggests that CX-COM is a viable new model for quantitative judgments and shows the importance of considering judgment variability in addition to average responses in judgment research.},

However, what if there are no other individuals’ judgments at one’s disposal? We investigated when an individual can avail themselves of the wisdom of their “inner crowd” to improve the quality of their confidence judgments by either (a) averaging their two confidence judgments or (b) selecting the higher of the two (i.e., maximizing) in two-alternative choice tasks. In a simulation analysis based on a signal detection model of confidence, we investigated how the “kindness” versus “wickedness” of items (i.e., the degree to which the majority of people chooses the correct or wrong answer) affect the performance of averaging and maximizing. Analytical and simulation results show that irrespective of the type of item, averaging consistently improves confidence judgments, but maximizing is risky: It outperformed averaging only once items were answered correctly 50–60 of the time or more—a result, which has not been established in prior work. We investigated the relevance of these effects in three empirical data sets since a person’s actual confidence judgments are redundant (median correlations ranged between .50 and .85). Averaging two confidence judgments from the same person was superior to maximizing, with Cohen’s d′s effect sizes ranging from 0.67–1.44. As people typically have no insight about the wickedness of the individual item, our results suggest that averaging—due to its robustness—should be the default strategy to harness one’s conflicting confidence judgments.},
